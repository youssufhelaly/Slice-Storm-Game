## Slice Storm

Slice Storm is a simple yet addictive fruit-slicing game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game challenges players to slice various fruits while avoiding dangerous bombs, all within a limited number of lives.

### Features:
- **Main Menu**: The game features a main menu where players can choose to start the game, access options, or quit the game.

- **Dynamic Difficulty Levels**: Choose from multiple difficulty levels - Easy, Normal, and Hard - each with its own unique challenges.
- **Pause Functionality**: Players can pause the game at any time to access the pause menu.
- **Game Over Screen**: When players run out of lives, a game over screen displays their final score and offers options to restart or return to the main menu.
